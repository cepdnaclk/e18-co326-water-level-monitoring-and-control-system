## Water level monitoring and control system
___

We are embarking on this project to develop a water level monitoring and automatically controlled water pump system. This project aims to provide an efficient and automated solution for monitoring water levels in tanks and controlling the water pump accordingly. By implementing this system, we can ensure optimal utilization of water, prevent overflow or shortages, and enable remote monitoring and control.

Hardware components:
- ESP8266
- Ultrasonic sensor
- Relay module
- Mini water pump

Protocols and Tools:
- MQTT
- Node-Red
